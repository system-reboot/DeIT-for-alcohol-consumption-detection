# Transfer learning induced DeIT for alcohol consumption detection

A Pytorch C++ based API for alcohol consumption detection using periocular NIR images on mobile devices. Here, we employ transfer learning induced [Data-efficient Image Transformer(DeIT)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12877.pdf) model for alcohol consumption detection using periocular NIR iris images.
